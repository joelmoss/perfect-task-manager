Perfect Task/Issue/Bug Manager
==============================

This document is intended to gather thoughts on what the world believes the perfect task manager, bug tracker or issue manager should be. There are so many of these services available, and most do it a little differently, but is there one that already exists that you would describe as being the perfect choice? If not, I want to know what features you would like to see in such a beast.
